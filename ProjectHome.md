System integration of four open-source projects: mpls-linux, quagga-ldp, OpenFlow, and NetFPGA, plus some python glue.

Additionally, NetFPGA Verilog source and a bitfile are provided that enable MPLS LSR support directly in the NetFPGA, providing an open-source platform  on which to write MPLS-capable network stack software.

Documentation on the current LSR functionality implemented in the NetFPGA hardware can be found at [Algo-Logic](http://algo-logic.com/lsr/).
